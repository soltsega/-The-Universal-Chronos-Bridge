 Compilation and Running Instructions:
 Note: this is on bash terminal whichis most popular. Optimize the command if you prefer to use another terminal like powershell.

1. Navigate to the project directory

   cd /home/solomon/Desktop/CP/calendar_converter

2. Create and enter the build directory
   mkdir -p build
   cd build

3. Generate build files with CMake
   
   cmake ..
   
4. Compile the code
   
   make
   
5. Run the program

   ./calendar_converter

For a Fresh Start (Clean Build)
If you want to ensure a clean build, use these commands:

cd /home/solomon/Desktop/CP/calendar_converter or your path to the directory. I wrote this in my path
rm -rf build/*
mkdir -p build
cd build
cmake ..
make
./calendar_converter

Additional Notes:
The program will create two log files:
 `report.txt` - Contains date conversion logs
 `holidays_report.txt` - Contains Bahere Hasab holiday calculations
